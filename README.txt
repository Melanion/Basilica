This project is an e-Commerce web application buitl using Ruby on Rails with a
MongoDB database which interfaces with computers on a Minecraft server running
the Mindcrack Pack for Feed the Beast. It allows real-time tracking of an in-
game storage system and allows users on the web and on the server to purchase
items from the storage, at which time the items are delivered to the user via
in-game systems.
